      History of Restaurant The restaurant, as a place where the focus was on
      the provision of meals, was born in France in the late eighteenth century.
      The development of the restaurant was assisted by the French Revolution in
      1789 when many chefs found themselves without employment, so set up their
      own restaurants.
